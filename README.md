Description:

This is the code-base for Team 6th Order Putterworth's robot to participate in UCSC's CMPE-118 Slug-O-Lympics Competition.
In this competition an autonomous robot must navigate an arena to navigate to one of potentially four active loading 
towers. There it will load ammo (three ping pong balls) and from there it must navigate to a target and score a goal
on at least two seperate targets. 

Directory Structure: 
* Drivers for various peripherals (drivers and sensors) are located in the Drivers folder. 
* Services for synchronous sampling and motor control in the services folder.
* EventCheckers for beacon, track wire, and bump detection in the EventCheckers folder.
